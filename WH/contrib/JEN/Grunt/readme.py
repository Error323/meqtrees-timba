"""The Grunt module has been developed for lowering the threshold for MeqTree users:

- MeqTree philosophy: create your own package, but use as much of
existing modules as possible. This requires us to offer the right
services (e.g. in the browser), and to suggest the kind of interfaces
that users find it easy to observe, so that they CAN share!

- Packaged functions (corrupt, correct)

- Collections of Jones matrices for different telescopes

  - Allows easy exchange between developers

- Simulation support (subtrees rather than MeqParms)

  - Defined with parameter groups

  - Deviation around the default value. a*cos(t/T)

  - Stddev of the simulation parameters a,T etc

  - Other deviation expressions

- Semi-automatic node naming (readability, uniqueness)

- Visualisation

  - Parameter values

  - Condeq residuals

  - Other nodes

- Parameter management (solving by named groups)

- Help

- Support for special solving schemes (peeling, redundancy)

- Interface with Meow system
