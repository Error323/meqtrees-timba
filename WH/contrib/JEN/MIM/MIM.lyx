\layout Abstract

An ionospheric model with a minimum number of parameters, and a minimum
 number of assumptions, is investigated.
 It is the basis for a practical procedure for ionospheric calibration for
 LOFAR.
 In addition to astronomical measurements on bright sources, it also proposes
 to use a network of GPS receivers.
 The MIM approach has more applications.

Introduction
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Introduction}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard


\series bold 
\emph on 
This document is very much a work in progress.
 This draft should lead eventually to a classic joint MIM paper.
 For the moment, it merely aspires to provide a joint framework for our
 various efforts to use the idea of a MIM to tame the ionosphere for LOFAR
 (and other) observations, and other applications.
 In this stage, it still contains many blank spots, to be filled in by various
 members of our little MIM community.
\layout Standard


\series bold 
By its nature, this document is also a little complicated, with many ifs
 and buts, and new ideas in various stages of maturity.
 However, the many strands come together in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:LOFAR-procedure}

\end_inset 

, which describes the proposed LOFAR procedure(s) for ionospheric calibration.
 
\layout Standard


\series bold 
Note: Throughout, we use 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset 

 for wavelength in the equations, while the text frequently refers to frequency.
 Perhaps this should be changed, also because the frequency is independent
 of the propagation medium.
 In any case, the relationship (in vacuum) is 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=300/f_{MHz}$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

We describe a scheme for the calibration of the ionosphere for radio astronomy.
 It is based on the so-called 
\emph on 
MIM-principle
\emph default 
, which stands for Minimim Ionospheric Model.
 It is explained in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:The-MIM-principle}

\end_inset 

.
 The proposed method applies to any radio telescope, but particular attention
 is given to the case of LOFAR, which operates at relatively low frequencies
 (20-240 MHz), and is thus more sensitive to ionospheric effects.
 
\layout Standard

The 
\emph on 
minimum
\emph default 
 in MIM stands for two things: Minimum assumptions about the ionosphere,
 and minimum number of parameters.
 The latter may be adapted dynamically as conditions change.
 The former is often difficult to maintain in practice.
 In order to emphasize the generality of the approach, the inclusion of
 any assumptions about the ionosphere is treated in an appendix (see appendix
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Bridging-the-gaps}

\end_inset 

).
 
\layout Standard

The MIM-principle allows a consistent framework (section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Solving-for-MIM}

\end_inset 

) in which astronomical measurements of the iononsphere (section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Measuring-TEC-astro}

\end_inset 

) may be combined with measurements made with GPS or other satellites (section
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Measuring-TEC-GPS}

\end_inset 

).
 This is an important feature, since the inclusion of GPS information can
 make LOFAR calibration much easier, and arguably better.
 Easier because it may replace a rather cumbersome phase-locking procedure,
 and better because the sampling of the ionosphere is both denser and wider.
 In some areas, like long baselines (>50 km), or polarization calibration,
 the extra GPS information may even be indispensible (e.g.
 by giving an absolute TEC, rather than a relative one).
 
\layout Standard

The MIM allows us to eliminate, or at least 
\emph on 
harmonize
\emph default 
, the inevitable offsets in ionospheric measurements.
 The resulting MIM-function is smooth and analytic, so it can be interpolated
 to give a value for the integrated TEC along an arbitrary line-of-sight.
 It can therefore be used to subtract radio sources from the uv-data, or
 to make images that are corrected for ionospheric effects.
\layout Standard

The MIM represents an improvement over earlier methods to calibrate the
 ionosphere, that have been used for telescopes like WSRT, VLA and GMRT.
 The connection is treated in some detail in an appendix.
 Especially the relation to 
\emph on 
field-based calibration
\emph default 
 by Cotton et al (see appendix 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Field-based-calibration}

\end_inset 

).
\layout Standard

Finally, there are other applications of the MIM principle as well.
 Examples are ionospheric research, improved GPS position determination,
 or even as a general harmonizing principle in other areas.
 See section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Other applications}

\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

Since this is a working document, section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Things-to-do}

\end_inset 

 has lists of things (to be) done, questions (to be) answered, and simulations
 (to be) carried out.
 An important goal is to develop a generic framework in MeqTrees, to which
 the various participants in this collaboration will converge in the coming
 months.
 
\layout Section

The MIM principle
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:The-MIM-principle}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

In our original plans for LOFAR calibration (cite LOFAR PDR, 2003), we were
 planning to solve for separate 2D phase screens across the FOV (main lobe
 and inner side-lobes) of individual stations.
 Such phase screens are able to account for all phenomena, much better than
 clumsy concepts like 
\emph on 
refraction
\emph default 
 and 
\emph on 
apparent position
\emph default 
.
 As a model, 2D screens are superior to the Zernike polynomials of field-based
 calibration 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Cotton}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

However, this approach would have required at least 3 parameters per station
 for a flat screen, and more to describe any curvature.
 This would need as many sources in the field, and our early calculations
 wrongly assumed that they would all have to be bright enough to yield a
 S/N>3 in 10 sec.
 Not surprisingly, this led to a rather gloomy picture.
 Other schemes based on calibrating 'patches' around bright sources lead
 to similarly unattractive numbers.
\layout Standard

Fortunately, ionospheric phenomena are rather large-scale (i.e.
 smooth) in space and time.
 This means that we can get away with an ionospheric model with rather fewer
 parameters, and consequently with fewer bright sources to estimate their
 values.
 It is important to realise that we are not interested in the structure
 or the physics of the ionosphere, but just in the observables (relative
 phase, Faraday rotation) that affect our observations.
 Thus, we are interested in the simplest model that describes these observables
 with sufficient accuracy.
 
\layout Standard

The basic idea behind the MIM is that we 
\emph on 
postulate the existence
\emph default 
 of a smooth function 
\begin_inset Formula $M(x,y,z,l,m,t)$
\end_inset 

 that gives us the integrated TEC along the line-of-sight from an arbitrary
 position 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y,z)$
\end_inset 

, in an arbitrary viewing direction 
\begin_inset Formula $(l,m)$
\end_inset 

, at a given time 
\begin_inset Formula $(t)$
\end_inset 

.
 The position will usually be that of a GPS station or a radio telescope/antenna
/station (index 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

), defined in some coordinate system (see appendix 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Coordinate-systems}

\end_inset 

).
 The direction (index 
\begin_inset Formula $rs$
\end_inset 

) will often be from receiver 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 towards a GPS satellite or an astronomical source (index 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

), defined in some coordinate system (appendix 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Coordinate-systems}

\end_inset 

 again).
 Depending on the selected reference frame, the direction may change with
 time
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

It is a bit unfortunate that all the relevant concepts (station, satellite,
 source) start with an 's'.
 Nevertheless, we will use an indexing scheme in which all receivers (stations,
 antennas, telescopes) are indexed with 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

, and all sources (satellites, astronomical sources) with 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

.
 A viewing direction from receiver 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 toweards source 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 will be indexed with 
\begin_inset Formula $rs$
\end_inset 

.
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

For the moment, we will assume that such a function exists at all.
 Few people doubt this assertion, but the subject is discussed in more depth
 in appendix 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Does-the-MIM-exist?}

\end_inset 

 below.
 Although the MIM function 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset 

 is 
\emph on 
pheanomenological
\emph default 
, it is often necessary in practice to make more specific assumptions about
 the ionosphere.
 In order to emphasize the difference between the general and the specific,
 all treatment of such assumptions has been relegated to the appendix (see
 appendix 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Bridging-the-gaps}

\end_inset 

).
\layout Standard

In principle, any set of smooth base functions will do for the MIM.
 More higher-order terms may then be used for more complex (less smooth)
 ionospheric conditions.
 For the moment, we will assume simple polynomials, which are easy to use.
 But there are alternatives with more desirable properties (see appendix
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: MIM-base-functions}

\end_inset 

).
 Whatever we use, the MIM function will have a number of time-dependent
 parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}(t)$
\end_inset 

, which will usually be the coefficients of its base functions:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
M=M(p_{0},p_{1},p_{2},\ldots,p_{n})\quad TECU\label{eq: M(p)}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

For an arbitrary set of arguments 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y,z,l,m,t)$
\end_inset 

, the MIM function uses the available values of its parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}(t)$
\end_inset 

 to calculate a TEC value.
 
\layout Standard

The 
\emph on 
'minimum'
\emph default 
 in MIM indicates on the one hand that we make minimal assumptions about
 (the structure of) the ionsphere, and on the other hand that we try to
 minimize the number of its parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset 

.
 The number of parameters may be dynamic, i.e.
 it may be increased or decreased as the ionospheric conditions change.
 This will of course only be feasible if we can somehow detect when the
 number of parameters is no longer optimal.
\layout Standard

The general procedure will be to use the various TEC measurements to solve
 (continuously) for the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}(t)$
\end_inset 

 of the MIM function 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset 

.
 Because the latter is smooth, this automatically 
\emph on 
harmonizes
\emph default 
 (...) the various offsets.
 If the resulting function is consistent with the measured values, i.e.
 the residuals are consistent with the expected noise level, we assume that
 it is also valid for other values of the arguments 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y,z,l,m,t)$
\end_inset 

, i.e.
 that it can be interpolated.
 Obviously, we will have more confidence in this if the number of TEC measuremen
ts is larger, and distributed more evenly.

This 
\series bold 
MIM diagram
\series default 
 has proved rather useful for discussing the combined use of GPS and radio
 measurements for estimating the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset 

 of a Minimum Ionospheric Model.
 Note that it squeezes a 5D function 
\begin_inset Formula $M(x,y,z,l,m)$
\end_inset 

 into a 2D diagram by collapsing the positions 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y,z)$
\end_inset 

 into one axis, and the view directions 
\begin_inset Formula $(l,m)$
\end_inset 

 into the other one.
 This is supposed to be done in such a way that proximity in either space
 still translates into proximity along its axis.
 Thus, stations that are close together, like in the LOFAR core, are close
 together on the horizontal axis.
 And sources that are close together in the sky, like in the LOFAR field-of-view
, are close together on the vertical axis.
 Note that we have chosen(l=RA, m=DEC) for the vertical axis, so astronomical
 sources and the FOV are stationary, while satellites move vertically.
 
\layout Standard


\emph on 
The MIM function 
\begin_inset Formula $M(x,y,z,l,m,t)$
\end_inset 

 is sampled at the crossing points of red lines (GPS satellites and ground
 stations), and of blue lines (radio sources and radio telescopes/stations).
 Note that, for a particular source or satellite, all instantaneous sampling
 points lie on a horizontal line.
 The latter will be straight if the direction of the source is the same
 for all receivers, and curved otherwise.
 Obviously, this depends on the coordinate frame that is selected for directions
 (see appendix 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Coordinate-systems}

\end_inset 

).
 The curvature will be slight if the receivers are relatively close together,
 i.e.
 within 100 km or so (see also fig ..).
 
\layout Standard


\emph on 
Ideally, the sampling function is sufficiently dense, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset 

 can be interpolated with confidence.
 Unfortunately, there are some largish gaps, which will have to be bridged
 somehow (see appendix 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Bridging-the-gaps}

\end_inset 

).
 But while it is always possible to increase the 
\series bold 
horizontal
\series default 
 sampling density by adding more stations, the 
\series bold 
vertical
\series default 
 sampling density is limited by the availability of satellites and/or bright
 radio sources.

A 
\emph on 
Measurement Equation
\emph default 
 (M.E.) is a mathematical description (model) of the combination of an observing
 istrument and the thing it observes.
 We will use two different instruments to measure the ionospheric TEC: an
 array of gound stations and satellites, and an array of LOFAR stations
 and astronomical radio sources.
 But although they are quite different, they both have an M.E.
 with the same generic form.
 If we

\begin_inset Formula $P_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 is given by the M.E.: 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
P_{rs}(pp,qq)=M_{rs}(pp)+Q_{rs}(qq)\quad TECU\label{eq: ME_generic}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

in which 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 is the MIM-function (with MIM parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset 

), and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 is an expression that contains measurement parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{m}$
\end_inset 

, i.e.
 the parameters of various error mechanisms.
 The latter have nothing to do with the ionosphere, but they do affect the
 TEC measurements.
 Examples of 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{m}$
\end_inset 

 are satellite-station bias values, or selfcal phase-zeroes, or antenna
 phase errors introduced by the electronics or the troposphere.
 In sections 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Measuring-TEC-GPS}

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Measuring-TEC-astro}

\end_inset 

 below, specific expressions for 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 are given.
 
\layout Standard

The parameters of the M.E.
 (i.e.
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset 

 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{m}$
\end_inset 

) may be estimated from the differences (residuals) 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 between measured predicted values.
 Thus, each sample generates a (linear) equation of the form:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Delta_{rs}=P_{rs}(pp,qq)-S_{rs}=\sum_{k}\frac{\partial M_{rs}}{\partial p_{k}}\Delta p_{k}+\sum_{m}\frac{\partial Q_{rs}}{\partial q_{m}}\Delta q_{m}\label{eq: ME_normal}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Note that we can construct the residuals 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 in different ways:

Equations and unknowns

\layout Standard

Ultimately, solving for parameters is a question of 
\series bold 
equations and unknowns
\series default 
.
 In particular, we need (many) more equations than unknown parameters, and
 the parameters must be sufficiently orthogonal, i.e.
 they must have signatures that are sufficiently distinct from each other.
 The power of the MIM is that it reduces the number of parameters to an
 absolute minimum.
 The small number of terms in the MIM function minimizes the number of 
\emph on 
spatial
\emph default 
 parameters by making maximum use of our 
\emph on 
a priori
\emph default 
 knowledge that the ionosphere is smooth in those dimensions.
 The same can be done for the

\emph default 
 dimension by replacing the 'parameters' 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset 

 (and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{m}$
\end_inset 

) by low-order polynomials (or other smooth functions) in time, and using
 the coefficients of these functions as the real parameters, to be solved
 for.
 
\emph on 
As will be argued below, the implementation of this time-smoothness constraint
 will be one of the more difficult aspects.
 
\layout Subsection

Smoothing in time
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub: Smoothing in time}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Since the MIM has a only a limited number of terms, and low-order ones at
 that, it is guaranteed to be smooth in position 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y,z)$
\end_inset 

 and direction 
\begin_inset Formula $(l,m)$
\end_inset 

.
 This has a harmonizing effect on MIM samples that are taken 
\emph on 
at the same time
\emph default 
, because the parts that are not consistent with a smooth MIM are ascribed
 to measurement errors.
 It is vital to have a similar mechanism that exploits our 
\emph on

\emph default 
 knowledge that the MIM is also smooth in time.
 
\series bold 
This turns our te be not so easy, and is perhaps the greatest practical
 problem that is facing us.
\layout Standard

A data processing system like MeqTrees operates with a succession of requests,
 each of which has a domain, i.e.
 a rectangular area in freq-time space.
 Usually, the freq-range is constant, while the time-range for successive
 requests advances with the size of the domain (see fig ...).
 
\layout Standard

Normally, a separate solution for the MIM parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}(t)$
\end_inset 

 is made for each request.
 This leads to a succession of MIMs, each with its own limited validity-domain,
 and possibly with continuity problems at the edges.
 In addition, the size of the domain, in both dimensions, limits the capability
 of the solver to separate effects with different (time, freq) signatures.
 The larger the domain, the greater the differences will be between effects
 that, for instance, behave linearly or quadratically in time.
 As will be seen in the next sections, the ionospheric TEC can only be distingui
shed from measurement effects (like GPS bias, or tropospheric phase) by
 its different time/freq signature.
 We have two options:
\layout Itemize

Use the largest practical domain size, determined by the available memory.
 This will often be enough, and the solver has the capability of detecting
 if we try to solve for more parameters than the available information allows.
\layout Itemize

Use the motion of GPS satellites, or the ionosphere itself, to impose constraint
s that imply time-smoothness (appendix 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Bridging-the-gaps}

\end_inset 

).
 
\layout Itemize

Develop the capability for solving for long-range parameters, i.e.
 parameters that have a larger/longer validity-domain (e.g.
 hours) than the size of a practical request domain (minutes).
 This is an essential capability, that has a wider importance for LOFAR
 than just the ionosphere.

GPS satellites move in roughly circular orbits around the Earth, with a

 the equator, which optimizes the combination of world coverage and relative
 velocity (see fig

 At an arbitrary position on Earth, at least 6 satellites are visible at
 any time.
 A passage from horizon to horizon takes a few hours, depending on its maximum
 elevation.
 They all move with the Earth rotation, to minimize the velocity w.r.t.
 the Earth surface.
 Most satellites have low elevations, most of the time, and it is quite
 rare for one to be actually inside the LOFAR FOV (5-10 deg).
 In the future we also hope to use satellites of Galileo, Glonass etc.

The GPS TEC Measurement Equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:The-GPS-TEC-ME}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

A sample 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 represents the integrated TEC along the line-of-sight between a station
 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 and satellite 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

.
 The station will have a fixed and accurately known Earth position 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{r},y_{r},z_{r})$
\end_inset 

, while the viewing direction 
\begin_inset Formula $(l_{rs},m_{rs})$
\end_inset 

 changes with time.
 Using a 2-frequency technique, a virtually instantaneous estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 of the integrated TEC may be made with a fundamental measurement 
\begin_inset Formula $noise$
\end_inset 

 of about 0.01 TECU (or 1 rad @ 74 MHz).
 Unfortunately, this is complicated by an unknown bias, which slowly drifts
 in time.
 Referring to equ 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq: ME_generic}

\end_inset 

 above, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 for the GPS M.E.
 can be expressed as: 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
Q_{rs}(t)=(q_{rs}+q_{1r}t+q_{2r}t^{2}+\cdots)+\frac{\phi_{r}^{tropos}}{-25\lambda}+noise\quad TECU\label{eq: Srs_GPS}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Expressions for the derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial q}$
\end_inset 

 are readily determined from this.
 Of course, the slow bias drift may be expressed by other functions than
 these low-order polynomials.
 Note that the constant 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 is associated with the station-satellite pair, while the drift parameters
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{ir}$
\end_inset 

 are associated with station 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

.
 The tropospheric phase 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{r}^{tropos}$
\end_inset 

 is right above station 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

, and easily distinguishable from the TEC since 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{r}\propto1/\lambda$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

It would be nice if we could associate a bias value with each station, and
 each satellite.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 satellites and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset 

 stations we would then have only 
\begin_inset Formula $(n+m)$
\end_inset 

 independent bias parameters in 
\begin_inset Formula $(n\times m)$
\end_inset 

 samples.
 Unfortunately, all the pair biases are different.
 But fortunately there is some commonality: the bias drifts are caused 
\emph on

The bias drift are probably caused by relatively cheap electonics, operating

This has been established on real data.
 It is another indication that the drifts are caused by environmental variations

Jim has verified (see appendix

 frequency is relatively close to one of the others.
 Galileo will use 3 frequencies, and we should do tests with the WSRT station.
 GPS will probably have them earlier, so we should be ready to use them
 to maximum advantage at the earliest opportunity.
 This will not require any great changes in the scheme that is being discussed
 in this document.
 If anything, it will simplify it, and produce more accurate results.
 In the meantime, we should just continue our present program.

In general, Jones matrices do not commute, so their order is important.
 The exception is a diagonal matrix with equal elements, which is equivalent
 to a (usually complex) scalar factor that can be placed anywhere in the

 This is the case for the TJones and ZJones, which also happen to be pure
 phase factors (to first order).
 For a single dominating source

\begin_inset Formula $i$

 the observed source.
 Note that the frequency dependence of the various terms is quite different:
 Only the ionospheric phase is 
\begin_inset Formula $\propto\lambda$
\end_inset 

, while the other phases are 
\begin_inset Formula $\propto\frac{1}{\lambda}$
\end_inset 

 (with the possible exception of the ionospheric Faraday rotation, but that
 is a second-order effect).
 This 'orthogonality' will be important when we try to solve for the ionosphere
 and other parameters simultaneously.
\layout Standard

The sensitivity and size of the LOFAR stations guarantees (even after the
 recent re-scope) that there is always at least one Cat I source in the
 FOV, i.e.
 a source that gives a 
\begin_inset Formula $S/N>3$
\end_inset 

 for each visibility sample in 10 s, provided we can use a bandwidth of
 at least 4 MHz.
 The latter condition means that, in order to get sufficient S/N for the
 non-linear conversion to phase, we usually have to integrate the visibilities
 of a number of 150 kHz subbands.
 This may be a problem if 
\begin_inset Formula $(M_{is}-M_{js})$
\end_inset 

 is large, because the ionospheric phases for each subband will be quite
 different (see fig 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap: AstroPredMeas}

\end_inset 

), so adding them causes decorrelation.
 Fortunately, because the ZJones matrix reduces to a scalar phase factor,
 we are allowed to 'lign up' the subband visibilities prior to adding them,
 by multiplying with the inverse factor:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\phi_{ijs}=arg(\sum_{subbands}V_{ijs}(\lambda)\; e^{25\lambda i(M_{is}-M_{js})})\label{eq: argsumV}\end{equation}

 Example of a measurement parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{m}$

 This equation looks a little more daunting than before, but it is just

 Because visibilities measure phase differences, all the station TEC values

 This means that they represent a strong constraint on the MIM, especially
 if the LOFAR array is large.
 In combination with GPS TEC measurements, which provide the absolute TEC,

Finally, The effectiveness of the separation of effects will improve linearly

One bright Cat I source in the FOV, and a network of GPS stations.

\series default 
 This might well be the preferred mode of operation for LOFAR.
 For each station, the rigid floating group (RFG) of astro TEC's represents
 a 'pivotal point' in its FOV.
 The (curved) phase screen across the rest of its FOV is constrained via
 the MIM by an arbitrarily dense pattern of GPS values outside the FOV.
 Although the GPS values have an (absolute!) accuracy of only 0.01 TECU (1
 rad @ 75 MHz), they constrain the phases inside the FOV to a much greater
 accuracy.
 This is partly due to the lever effect, and partly through a 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}$

 effect.

NB: In discussions about dynamic range, it sould be kept in mind that the

Acquiring and maintaining phase-lock
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub: phase-locking}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

A selfcal solution is only possible if there are no 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset 

 ambiguities, i.e.
 if the 
\emph on

\emph default 
 are within about a radian to begin with.
 Since the differential (!) ionospheric variations can be much larger than

\begin_inset Foot

\layout Standard

Phase tracking is also important for integrating longer (many minutes),
 to measure LOFAR beamshape parameters in the direction of fainter sources.
 
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

It is expected that GPS measurements will easily produce the differential
 accuracy that is needed for phase-locking.
 As a backup alternative, the following more cumbersome and time-consuming
 phase-locking procedure may be followed for LOFAR.
 A continuous selfcal phase solution on one or more bright sources starts
 with 3 stations in the core.
 The other stations are included one by one, moving outwards from the centre.
 The phase of this new station is varied by steps of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset 

, until the solution is consistent (phase-lock).
 Its phase will then be continuously tracked while the remaining stations
 are included, and during the subsequent observations.
\layout Standard

Note that phase-tracking takes the shape of an approximate MIM, i.e.
 a MIM in which the values of its parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}(t)$
\end_inset 

 are only accurate enough to give a phase accuracy better than a radian.
 Obviously, the measurement parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{k}$
\end_inset 

 must also be 'accurate enough' in this stage.
 The values of all parameter values are then improved in to the required
 level the subsequent stages.

Peeling
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Peeling}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard


\series bold 
NB: Simultaneous solutions are not possible, because we cannot pre-correct
 the visibilities for ionospheric phase.
 So, peeling is indispensible, once again.....
 
\layout Standard

Only the bright Cat I sources are used to estimate instrumental parameters
 (because, by definition, they are the only ones that give sufficient S/N
 in the available integration time).
 When there is more than one Cat I source in the field, one has the choice
 between two approaches.
 The first is making a single simultanous selfcal solution for all the relevant
 parameters.
 This is OK if there are only uv-plane effects, or if the number of direction-de
pendent parameters is small.
 Otherwise, the solution may become unstable because the number of parameters
 is too large.
 
\layout Standard

An alternative approach is 
\emph on 
peeling
\emph default 

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{JEN peeling}

\end_inset 

: A separate selfcal solution is made for each Cat I source, after which
 it is subtracted from the uv-data.
 Obviously, this must be done in order of decreasing apparent brightness.
 In this way, the number of parameters per solution never exceeds that of
 a 'classical' selfcal, i.e.
 with uv-plane effects only.
 Other advantages are smaller solution matrices (fewer parameters) and the
 possibility of shifting the phase centre of the uv-data to the position
 of the peeling source.
\layout Standard

A potential problem with peeling is the contamination caused by the other
 sources in the field.
 This will 'skew' the selfcal solution, and cause incomplete subtraction
 of the peeling source.
 The solution is to include a few of the brightest contamination sources
 in the selfcal predict.
 The prediction does not have to be very accurate, since contamination is
 non-linear.
 At the faint end, the 
\emph on 
collective
\emph default 
 contamination caused by the vector sum of many faint sources, that are
 distributed more or less homogeneoulsy, may be compensated by a gain factor
 (
\series bold 
called the Van der Tol factor, provided he comes up with an expression
\series default 
).
 Thus, at the cost of extra processing, the contamination can be reduced
 to an arbitrarily low level.
 
\layout Standard

Since each selfcal solution is independent, each solution will introduce
 a different selfcal offset.
 These have to be harmonized by the MIM.
 NB: A simultaneous solution for image-plane effects, i.e.
 independent phases in the direction of different sources, will also produce
 multiple independent offsets, just like peeling and rapid repointing.
 The reason is that, for each source direction, one may add an arbitrary
 phase offset to all the station phases.
 These will all cancel out in the differential phase of the measured visibility.

 Because the ionospheric contribution to the phase for an interferometer
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{ijs}=-25\lambda(M_{is}-M_{js})$
\end_inset 

, the phases of the visibilities for different subbands (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset 

) will be quite different if the TEC difference 
\begin_inset Formula $(M_{is}-M_{js})$
\end_inset 

 is large.
 If we want to integrate the subband visibilities to get sufficient S/N
 before converting to phase, we have to correct them for the ionospheric
 phase before adding them.
 Fortunately, this is allowed since the ZJones matrix reduces to a scalar
 phase factor, and can be placed anywhere in the Jones chain.

Possible LOFAR procedure(s)
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:LOFAR-procedure}

Using a mix of GPS and astronomical TEC measurements, and some judicial
 extra constraints, LOFAR may adopt a range of MIM-based procedures.
 
\emph on 
This section is the heart of this document, since it brings all the strands
 together.
 
\layout Standard

We propose a preferred 
\emph on 
default
\emph default 
 procedure (see fig 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:The-default-procedure}

\end_inset 

) and some variations on this theme.
 It use a single bright astronomical (Cat I) source, to produce a Rigid
 Floating Group (RFG) of MIM samples.
 An array of GPS receivers is used to constrain the MIM further.
 The reasons for this choice are:
\layout Itemize

It requires only one Cat I source in the FOV.
 This is especially important for the smaller station sensitivity after
 re-scoping.
\layout Itemize

It maximizes the chance of measuring absolute TEC.
 This is not possible with astroTECs, even wideband.
\layout Itemize

It works for a LOFAR with an array smaller than the FOV-footprint (~30km)
 on the ionosphere.
\layout Itemize

It avoids the need for rapid repointing.
\layout Itemize

It requires minimum processing...

Default procedure
\layout Standard

The proposed default procedure has the following steps (see fig

\series bold 
Acquiring phase-lock:
\series default 
 Create the conditions for making selfcal solutions on bright sources, without

 This means getting the 
\emph on 
interferometer phase errors

 (differential!) within a radian.
 A good first step is the use of the calibration dipoles that are associated
 with every station, which always 'see' Cas A.
 This requires the somewhat cumbersome trial-and-error procedure described
 in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub: phase-locking}

\end_inset 

.
 This might be speeded with the help of GPS stations around the LOFAR array.
 The last step must always be the inclusion of the brightest Cat I source
 inside the FOV, since that is the only way to check whether the MIM is
 sufficently accurate for phase-tracking inside the FOV.

Variation: Use multiple sources in the FOV
\layout Standard

If the LOFAR array is larger than the footprint (~30km) of the FOV on the
 ionosphere, the curvature of the MIM over the entire FOV may be constrained.
 So, one Cat I is sufficient in this case.
 If the LOFAR array is too small (e.g.
 only the 3km core), extra constraints are needed.
\layout Standard

Selfcal on other bright Cat I sources in the field (NB: This may have to
 be done in any case, to subtract them with maximum accuracy).
 Use either a simultaneous solution, or peeling.
 The extra samples constrain the MIM curvature, by simply adding extra equations
 to the MIM solution matrix.
 Limiting factors are the availability of sources, and the independent phase
 offsets introduced by each selfcal solution.
 
\layout Subsection

Variation: Rapid repointing
\layout Standard

It has been suggested that we should measure the ionosphere (MIM?) by using
 a small part (10-20%?) of the integration time to rapidly repoint the station
 beams to a few bright sources outside the FOV.
 This involves rapidly changing the beamformer weights, maximizing the sensitivi
ty in the direction of these sources.
 This has the additional advantage of sampling the MIM-function more widely,
 and making the parameter space for instrumental effects 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{m}$
\end_inset 

 more orthogonal.
 But it will quite a burden on the LOFAR observation system.

NB: Personally, I hope that this will not be necessary.
 But I support the (non-trivial) implementation of this capability, because
 I am sure that the availability of such an unusual observational mode can
 lead to unexpected discoveries.

 the EJones gains will be (very) different.

\layout Standard

We have outlined the MIM 
\emph on 
principle
\emph default 
, and proposed a procedure to use it to calibrate ionospheric observations
 of LOFAR (and other radio telescopes).
 The 6D MIM-function 
\begin_inset Formula $M(x,y,z,l,m,t)$
\end_inset 

 is used as a smoothing agent to combine astronomical and GPS measurements
 of the ionospheric TEC , and to separate them from instrumental effects.
 The MIM function is then interpolated to subtract Cat II radio sources
 from the uv-data, and to correct the residuals before (facet) imaging.
 The MIM principle is quite general, so it has other applications as well.
\layout Standard

In this document we have tried to identify the possibilities and limitations
 of the MIM method.
 Now is the time to descend into the arena of actual experiments.
 We propose to demonstrate the capabilities of the MIM in the context of
 the MeqTree system, as a trail-blazer for the eventual LOFAR implementation
 in BBS.
 
\layout Standard

One of the most urgent tasks is to develop the capability of solving for
 long-range parameters, i.e.
 parameters that have a validity domain that is greater (longer) than the
 domain of a practical data-snippet.
 This is needed to distinguish the ionospheric TEC from instrumental effects.
 For the same reason, we must deal with the widest possible frequency-range.

\layout Standard

The ionosphere is an electrically charged 'layer' in the Earth atmosphere,
 located roughly between 100-500 km altitude.
 The propagation velocity of radio waves is (slightly) reduced by the electric
 charge of its free electrons.
 Since the electron density, and thus the r

, varies with 3D position, this causes an error in the 
\emph on

\emph default 
 measured by the two widely spaced antennas of a radio interferometer.
 If not corrected, such phase errors may cause significant blurring and
 distortions in the resulting image of the radio sky.
 Moreover, since the propagation velocity is slightly different for right
 and left circular polarization, the ionosphere also causes Faraday rotation,
 i.e.
 a rotation of the plane of linear

 velocity is most easily described using the circular representation.

 It should be noted that the effect on the phase of a radio interferometer

For the common case of large-scale ionospheric structure, i.e.
 travelling 'blobs' that are much larger than the array, there will be a
 (roughly) linear phase gradient over the array, which slowly changes in
 time: 
\begin_inset Formula $T\approx p_{0}(t)+p_{1}(t)\, x$

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta T\approx p_{1}(x)\Delta x$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\phi\approx-25\lambda p_{1}(t)\Delta x$
\end_inset

 Thus, at any given time, the the interferometric phase error will increase
 roughly linearly with baseline length 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset 

 (and linearly with wavelength 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

The statistics of ionospheric phase variations.
 This is a schematic version of the (differential!) phase that was actually
 measured with a baseline of 10 km, in an observation of Virgo A by the
 VLA @ 74 Mhz.
 It should be noted that the ionospheric conditions were somewhat unusual.
 The variations shows a Kolmogorov-like bahaviour, in which larger ones
 (of hundreds of radians) have longer time-scales.
 So, somewhat paradoxically, we should worry more about the smaller phase
 variations, because they are too rapid to track.
 Large, smooth variations can (and must) be tracked, keeping in mind that
 a linear change of phase of one radian during the integration time causes
 a decorrelation (decrease in amplitude) of the signal of 4%.
 The LOFAR calibration scheme assumes that phases will change by less than
 1 radian in 10 s.
 This limit is exceeded only rarely, and mostly at low frequencies (<30
 MHz).

\emph on 
The largest phase variations are caused by Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances

 This is illustrated on the right.
 The left shows the quiescent ionosphere, which has small variations that

 do increase the noise).
 Note that the quiescent variations are still present on top of the TID.

Ionospheric delay

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
L=\lambda\frac{\phi}{2\pi}\approx-4\lambda^{2}T\quad m\label{eq: TEC2meter}\end{equation}

\layout Standard

So, a TEC of one TECU corresponds to a delay of -64 m @ 75 MHz, or -16 cm
 @ 1400 MHz.
 Since the latter is roughly the frequency of the GPS carrier wave, we can
 also say that an error of one TECU in a TEC measurement would cause a position
 error of 16 cm.
\layout Standard

Like the differential phase in appendix 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Ionospheric-phase}

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta L=-0.16\: p_{1}(t)\:\Delta x$

 But we assume (.?.) that this is corrected on-line in either the satellite

Ionospheric Faraday rotation
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Faraday-rotation}

 The deviations in direction and strength vary as a position of Earth position

 Fortunately the vector-field 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{B}$

 This means that, if the TEC is locally smooth (as we assume it to be most

 It will probably consist of a set of base-functions (terms), whose coefficients

 Jim will endeavour to investigate this further, also in the context of
 the fact that the ionospheric bias drops from the equations when determining
 relative positions close (within 100 m?) to another GPS receiver.

In any case, even if this 'triangulation' works, it does not sample the

Travelling 'frozen' pattern
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub: The-'frozen'-pattern}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The ionospheric phase 'screen' sometimes (?) appears to manifests itself
 as a 'frozen' pattern, which changes only slowly while travelling with
 a velocity of 500-1000 km/h (165-330 m/s), towards the South or the West
 (?).
 It has been suggested that we should use this as an additional constraint.
 
\layout Standard

The MIM approach deals automatically with changing patterns because we solve
 for time-dependent MIM parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}(t)$
\end_inset 

.
 We might impose further constraints by limiting the amount of change we
 allow per unit time for each parameter.
 A perhaps better approach is to by reformulate the MIM function in terms
 of a velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}=(v_{x},v_{y})$
\end_inset

 It would even be possible to solve for the velocity components, by making
 them part of the regular MIM parameters

How do we solve for MIM (and other) parameters that have a validity-domain

This is an important issue, since LOFAR can only be calibrated if we can

Even if the intermediate results are cached by the minimum number of nodes,
 their total size in a big reduction tree would quickly overwhelm the available
 memory if the request domain were greater than a few minutes.
\end_inset 

.
 Examples are the parameters of the station beamshapes.
 A proper estimation requires more sampling points than there are bright
 Cat I sources.
 We therefore have to promote some of the brighter Cat II sources to Cat
 I status, but that requires longer integration.
 Another example, which is more directly relevant here, is the GPS bias,
 which is assumed to be 'constant' in time.
 
\layout Standard

First we attempt to separate various effects by taking the largest possible
 domain.
 If that fails, we have to resort to long-range parameters.
\layout Standard

The idea is for the MeqParm to remember the history of the values of its
 polc coefficients....
 Prediction, inertia, limitation, skipping of outliers, ...
\layout Standard

The limitations are that the new information cannot easiliy be translated
 back, so that there is a switch-on effect, or lag-effect (This converges
 to zero in a multi-pass scheme like the Major Cycle).

Another problem is how to deal with (i.e.
 detect, incorporate) legitimate jumps in the MeqParm values.

 How do we solve for MIM (and other) parameters that have a validity-domain
 that is longer in time than the solution-domain? One solution is to build
 extra intelligence in the parameter object, so that it keeps track of its
 own history, and can take intelligent decisions.
 First of all it may extrapolate in time, giving a better starting value
 for the next snippet.
 This value may also be used to reject new values that are 'bad', i.e.
 that differ too much from the expected value.

 The history that the object retains could be in the form of small solution

 The matrices would solve for the coefficients of the time-function of each

 Accepted new values (increments) may be accumulated, and the matrices may

\begin_inset Formula $C$

 is an appropriate conversion constant, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{i}$
\end_inset 

 is the measurement error.
 Forming the three possible differences, we get three new equations:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
L_{ij}=L_{i}-L_{j}=(B_{i}-B_{j})+(\epsilon_{i}-\epsilon_{j})+T\times C\times(f_{i}^{-2}-f_{j}^{-2})\label{eq: Lij}\end{equation}

\layout Standard

Without loss of generality, we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{1}-B_{3}=(B_{1}-B_{2})+(B_{2}-B_{3})$
\end_inset

 So then there are three equations, with three measurement values 
\begin_inset Formula $(L_{i}-L_{j})$

\begin_inset Formula $(B_{1}-B_{2})$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $(B_{2}-B_{3})$

\begin_inset Formula $T$

 The measurement errors 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{i}$

 just contribute to the noise.

Special case: phase gradients (AGB, WSRT)
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec: WSRT-phase-gradients}

\layout Standard

With WSRT LFFFE observations, it is only possible to make a selfcal solution
 for 14 individual telescope phases when there is a 3C source (10-100 Jy)
 in the field.
 In general, the brightest source is only 5 Jy or less (give S/N calculations).
 In those cases, the data must be corrected with the help of calibrator
 observations before and after.
 At 115 MHz, this would have led to a rather poor dynamic range, because
 even the benign ionosphere of the fall of 2004 causes appreciable and time-vari
able phase gradients over the 3 km array.
 Fortunately, there was usually enough flux in the available sources to
 solve for this phase-gradient (one parameter).

\emph on 
This little anecdote contains the key to the reduction of observations with
 LOFAR, and other low-frequency radio telescope.
 The point is that we should try to find the ionospheric model with the
 smallest number of parameters, which still describes the observed phases
 with sufficient accuracy.
 This is what the MIM endeavours to do.

Relation to field-based calibration (Cotton, VLA)
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec: Field-based-calibration}

NB: This is an important section, because it describes the most succesful
 technique to date for radio-astronomical ionosphere calibration.
 Not surprisingly, it is not un-MIM-like, but a real MIM can do better.
\layout Standard

Field-based calibration 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Cotton}

\end_inset 

 has been used succesfully by Cotton, Lazio and others to calibrate the
 ionosphere above the VLA.
 Especially @ 74 MHz (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=4$
\end_inset 

m, 
\begin_inset Formula $bw\approx1$
\end_inset 

MHz).
 The procedure is as follows:
\layout Enumerate

Every hour (or so), an instrumental calibration is done using the bright
 source Cas A.
 This removes the antenna-based phase errors, e
\emph on 
xcept for a linear phase-gradient over the array
\emph default 
, which is assumed to be caused by the ionosphere.
\layout Enumerate

Snapshot images are made every minute (or so), and the positions of the
 sources in the field that are bright enough to be detected are measured.
 These are compared to their catalog positions (NVSS, LVSS).
 
\layout Enumerate

The measured source position differences are converted into phase gradients.
 These are then used to fit an overall phase-function 
\emph on 
in the image-plane
\emph default 
 (e.g.
 a set of Zernike polynomials).
 Fitting entails finding values for the coefficients of the base-functions,
 so that the gradient is the same as the measured phase gradients.
\layout Enumerate

The end result is a group of time-series, each of which represents a time-depend
ent parameter of the ionospheric phase-function.
 
\layout Enumerate

The ionospheric phase function represents an image-plane effect.
 It is applied in the usual way, i.e.
 by facet imaging.
 The total FOV is divided up into a number of facets (in this case centered
 on the source used).
 The uv-data are corrected for the centre of a facet, and then transformed
 to a small facet image.
 These are then stitched together.
\layout Standard

The Zernicke polynomials are clearly a form of MIM.
 The difference is that they are derived from position measurements, which
 imply linear phase gradients.
 This assumption can only be valid for baselines smaller than about 5-10
 km.
 This is readily verified by looking at the consistency of the Zernicke
 solution per antenna.
 It deteriorates for the outlying VLA antennas, i.e.
 for the longer baselines.
 Nevertheless, field-based calibration has been quite succesful, but is
 limited by the VLA sensitivity @ 74 MHz.
 Recently, Cotton has been investigating alternative base-functions.
\layout Standard

Recently, Huib Intema 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Intema SPAM}

\end_inset 

 has shown that a MIM-based approach (SPAM) gives better results on the
 same data:
\layout Itemize

First, 27 antenna phases are obtained in the direction of each bright source.
 This is done by peeling 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{JEN peeling}

\end_inset 

, i.e.
 treating each source as though it is the only one in the field.
 This is done in order of decreasing brightness.
 Contamination from other sources is minimized by subtracting everything
 but the 'peeling' source.
 Depending on source brightness, the integration time of the solution is
 varied from a minumin of 10s to a maximum of 5 min.
 
\layout Itemize

He then uses the 27 VLA antenna phases (x,y,z,l,m) in the direction of each
 source (l,m) to solve for MIM parameters, i.e.
 the coefficients of a set of simple polynomials.
 
\emph on 
(..integration time..?)
\layout Itemize

Correction is the same as in field-based calibration, i.e.
 per facet.
\layout Standard

The results of the two techniques are compared in fig 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Field-based-calibration}

\end_inset 

.
 Recently, Zernicke polynomials have been replaced with KL functions, giving
 a much better (smoother) behaviour far from the sampling points.
 Also, the noise in the final image was lower.
 
\layout Standard

SPAM has all the ingredients that concern us for LOFAR: peeling, choice
 of MIM, solver integration times, visualization, etc.
 It is a prime candidate for implementation in MeqTrees.
 A possible improvement would be to express the antenna phases directly
 in terms of the (much smaller number of) MIM parameters, and solving directly
 for the latter.
 However, this approach may clash with peeling.....
