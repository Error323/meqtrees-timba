\series bold 
\emph on 
This document is very much a work in progress.
 This draft should lead eventually to a classic joint MIM paper.
 For the moment, it merely aspires to provide a joint framework for our
 various efforts to use the idea of a MIM to tame the ionosphere for LOFAR
 (and other) observations, and other applications.
 In this stage, it still contains many blank spots, to be filled in by various
 members of our little MIM community.
\layout Standard

We describe a scheme for the calibration of the ionosphere for radio astronomy.
 It is based on the so-called 
\emph on 
MIM-principle
\emph default 
, which stands for Minimim Ionospheric Model.
 The proposed method applies to any radio telescope, but particular attention
 is given to the case of LOFAR, which operates at relatively low frequencies
 (20-240 MHz), and is thus more sensitive to ionospheric effects.
 
\layout Standard

The 
\emph on 
minimum
\emph default 
 in MIM stands for two things: Minimum assumptions about the ionosphere,
 and minimum number of parameters.
 The latter may be adapted dynamically as conditions change.
 The former is often difficult to maintain in practice.
 In order to emphasize the generality of the approach, the inclusion of
 any assumptions about the ionosphere is treated in an appendix (see section
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Bridging-the-gaps}

\end_inset 

).
 
\layout Standard

The MIM-principle allows a consistent framework in which astronomical measuremen
ts of the iononsphere may be combined with measurements made with GPS (or
 other) satellites.
 This is an important feature, since the inclusion of GPS information can
 make LOFAR calibration much easier, and arguably better.
 In some areas, like long baselines (>50 km), or polarization calibration,
 the extra GPS information may even be indispensible.
 The MIM allows us to eliminate, or at least 
\emph on 
harmonize
\emph default 
, the inevitable offsets in ionospheric measurements.
 The resulting MIM-function is smooth and analytic, and can be interpolated
 to give a value for the integrated TEC along an arbitrary line-of-sight.
 It can therefore be used to subtract radio sources from the uv-data, or
 to make images that are corrected for ionospheric effects.
\layout Standard

The MIM represents an improvement over earlier methods to calibrate the
 ionosphere, that have been used for telescopes like WSRT, VLA and GMRT.
 The connection is treated in some detail in an appendix.
 Especially the relation to 
\emph on 
field-based calibration
\emph default 
 by Cotton et al (see section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Field-based-calibration}

\end_inset 

).
\layout Standard

Finally, there are other applications of the MIM principle as well.
 Examples are ionospheric research, improved GPS position determination,
 or even as a general harmonizing principle in other areas.
 See section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Other applications}

\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

Since this is a working document, section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Things-to-do}

\end_inset 

 has lists of things (to be) done, questions (to be) answered, and simulations
 (to be) carried out.
 An important goal is to develop a generic framework in MeqTrees, to which
 the various participants in this collaboration will converge in the coming
 months.
 
\layout Section

The MIM principle
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:The-MIM-principle}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

In our original plans for LOFAR calibration (cite LOFAR PDR, 2003), we were
 planning to solve for separate 2D phase screens across the FOV (main lobe
 and inner side-lobes) of individual stations.
 Such screens are entirely sufficient to account for all phenomena, and
 as a model they are superior to the Zernike polynomials (Cotton et al)
 and clumsy concepts like refraction and apparent position.
 
\layout Standard

However, this approach would have required at least 3 parameters per station
 for a flat screen, and more to describe any curvature.
 This would need as many sources in the field, and our early calculations
 wrongly assumed that they would all have to be bright enough to yield a
 S/N>3 in 10 sec.
 Not surprisingly, this led to a rather gloomy picture.
 Other schemes based on calibrating 'patches' around bright sources lead
 to similarly unattractive numbers.
\layout Standard

Fortunately, ionospheric phenomena are rather large-scale (i.e.
 smooth) in space and time.
 This means that we can get away with an ionospheric model with rather fewer
 parameters, and consequently with fewer bright sources to estimate their
 values.
 It is important to realise that we are not interested in the structure
 or the physics of the ionosphere, but just in the observables (relative
 phase, Faraday rotation) that affect our observations.
 Thus, we are interested in the simplest model that describes these observables
 with sufficient accuracy.
 
\layout Standard

The basic idea behind the MIM is that we 
\emph on 
postulate the existence
\emph default 
 of a smooth function 
\begin_inset Formula $M(x,y,z,l,m,t)$
\end_inset 

 that gives us the integrated TEC along the line-of-sight from an arbitrary
 position 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y,z)$
\end_inset 

, in an arbitrary viewing direction 
\begin_inset Formula $(l,m)$
\end_inset 

.
 The position will usually be that of a GPS station or a radio telescope/antenna
/station 
\begin_inset Formula $(r)$
\end_inset 

, defined in some coordinate system (see section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Coordinate-systems}

\end_inset 

).
 The direction 
\begin_inset Formula $(rs)$
\end_inset 

 will often be from receiver 
\begin_inset Formula $(r)$
\end_inset 

 towards a GPS satellite or an astronomical source 
\begin_inset Formula $(s)$
\end_inset 

, defined in some coordinate system (section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Coordinate-systems}

\end_inset 

 again).
 Depending on the selected reference frame, the direction may change with
 time
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

It is a bit unfortunate that all the relevant concepts (station, satellite,
 source) start with an 's'.
 Nevertheless, we will use an indexing scheme in which all receivers (stations,
 antennas, telescopes) are indexed with 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

, and all sources (satellites, astronomical sources) with 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

.
 A viewing direction from receiver 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 toweards source 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 will be indexed with 
\begin_inset Formula $rs$
\end_inset 

.
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

For the moment, we will assume that such a function exists at all.
 This subject is discussed in more depth in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Does-the-MIM-exist?}

\end_inset 

 below.
\layout Standard

The MIM function 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset 

 is 
\emph on 
pheanomenological
\emph default 
, i.e.
 it is not concerned with the internal structure of the ionosphere, but
 only with its effect on the observations.
 However, in practice, it is often necessary to make more specific assumptions,
 for instance about the ionosphere.
 In order to emphasize the difference, their treatment has been relegated
 to the appendix.
\layout Standard

In principle, any set of smooth base functions will do for the MIM.
 More higher-order terms may then be used for more complex (less smooth)
 ionospheric conditions.
 For the moment, we will assume simple polynomials, which are easy to use.
 But there are alternatives with more desirable properties (see section
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: MIM-base-functions}

\end_inset 

).
 Whatever we use, the MIM function will have a number of time-dependent
 parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}(t)$
\end_inset 

, which will usually be the coefficients of its base functions:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
M=M(p_{0},p_{1},p_{2},\ldots,p_{n})\quad TECU\label{eq: M(p)}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The requirement is that, for an arbitrary set of arguments 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y,z,l,m,t)$
\end_inset 

, the MIM function uses the current values of its parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}(t)$
\end_inset 

 to calculate a TEC value.
 
\layout Standard

The 
\emph on 
'minimum'
\emph default 
 in MIM indicates on the one hand that we make minimal assumptions about
 (the structure of) the ionsphere, and on the other hand that we try to
 minimize the number of its parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset 

.
 The number of parameters may be dynamic, i.e.
 it may be increased or decreased as the ionospheric conditions change.
 This will of course only be feasible if we can somehow detect when the
 number of parameters is no longer optimal.
\layout Standard

The general procedure will be to use the various TEC measurements to solve
 (continuously) for the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}(t)$
\end_inset 

 of the MIM function 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset 

.
 Because the latter is smooth, this automatically 
\emph on 
harmonizes
\emph default 
 (...) the various offsets.
 If the resulting function is consistent with the measured values, i.e.
 the residuals are smaller than the noise, we assume that it is also valid
 for other values of the arguments 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y,z,l,m,t)$
\end_inset 

, i.e.
 that it can be interpolated.
 Obviously, we will have more confidence in this if the number of TEC measuremen
ts is larger, and distributed more evenly.
 This is illustrated in the 
\series bold 
MIM diagram

\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{cap:MIM diagram}

\end_inset 

This 
\series bold 
MIM diagram
\series default 
 has proved rather useful for discussing the combined use of GPS and radio
 measurements for estimating the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset 

 of a Minimum Ionospheric Model.
 Note that it squeezes a 5D function 
\begin_inset Formula $M(x,y,z,l,m)$
\end_inset 

 into a 2D diagram by collapsing the positions 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y,z)$
\end_inset 

 into one axis, and the view directions 
\begin_inset Formula $(l,m)$
\end_inset 

 into the other one.
 This is supposed to be done in such a way that proximity in either space
 still translates into proximity along its axis.
 Thus, stations that are close together, like in the LOFAR core, are close
 together on the horizontal axis.
 And sources that are close together in the sky, like in the LOFAR field-of-view
, are close together on the vertical axis.
 Note that we have chosen(l=RA, m=DEC) for the vertical axis, so astronomical
 sources and the FOV are stationary, while satellites move vertically.
 
\layout Standard


\emph on 
The MIM function 
\begin_inset Formula $M(x,y,z,l,m,t)$
\end_inset 

 is sampled at the crossing points of red lines (GPS satellites and ground
 stations), and of blue lines (radio sources and radio telescopes/stations).
 Note that, for a particular source or satellite, all instantaneous sampling
 points lie on a horizontal line.
 The latter will be straight for astronomical arrays, but slightly curved
 for large arrays of GPS stations.
 
\layout Standard


\emph on 
Ideally, the sampling function is sufficiently dense, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset 

 can be interpolated with confidence.
 Unfortunately, there are some largish gaps, which will have to be bridged
 somehow (see section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Bridging-the-gaps}

\end_inset 

).
 But while it is always possible to increase the 
\series bold 
horizontal
\series default 
 sampling density by adding more stations, the 
\series bold 
vertical
\series default 
 sampling density is limited by the availability of satellites and/or bright
 radio sources.

Solving for MIM (and other) parameters
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Solving-for-MIM}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

In this section we define a generic framework that can be used to solve
 for MIM parameters in any application based on the MIM principle.
 In the next two sections we show how the samples taken with GPS and radio
 astronomical measurements can be combined in this framework.
 
\layout Subsection

Generating equations
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Generating-equations}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

We solve for MIM parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}(t)$
\end_inset 

, and any 
\emph on 
measurement parameters
\emph default 
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{m}(\lambda,t)$
\end_inset 

, by finding those values of the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{m}$
\end_inset 

 that minimize the differences (residuals) 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 between measured and calculated TEC values at the sampling points 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{r},y_{r},z_{r},l_{rs},m_{rs})$
\end_inset 

.
 Samples are from receiver 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

, in the direction of source 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

.
 Each TEC sample 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{rs}$
\end_inset 

, measured either with GPS or by astronomical means, can be expressed as:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
S_{rs}(\lambda,t)=T_{rs}(t)+Q_{rs}(\lambda,t,qq)\quad TECU\label{eq: STrs_generic}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

in which 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{rs}(t)$
\end_inset 

 is the 
\emph on 
true
\emph default 
 integrated TEC, and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{rs}(\lambda,t,qq)$
\end_inset 

 is an expression that contains 
\emph on 
measurement parameters
\emph default 
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{m}(\lambda,t)$
\end_inset 

, and noise.
 Examples of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 are satellite-station bias values, or selfcal phase-zeroes, or antenna
 phase errors introduced by the electronics or the troposphere.
 In sections 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Measuring-TEC-GPS}

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Measuring-TEC-astro}

\end_inset 

 below, specific expressions for 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 are given.
 
\layout Standard

If we now replace the true TEC 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 with its model 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 (i.e.
 the MIM), we get:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
S_{rs}(\lambda,t)=M_{rs}(t,pp)+Q_{rs}(\lambda,t,qq)\quad TECU\label{eq: Srs_generic}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The residuals 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 that are to be minimized can now be expressed as a linear equation of the
 form:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Delta_{rs}(\lambda,t)=M_{rs}(t,pp)+Q_{rs}(\lambda,t,qq)-S_{rs}(\lambda,t)=\sum_{k}\frac{\partial M_{rs}(t)}{\partial p_{k}}\Delta p_{k}+\sum_{m}\frac{\partial Q_{rs}(\lambda,t)}{\partial q_{m}}\Delta q_{m}\label{eq: normal}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The 
\emph on 
variables
\emph default 
 in this equation, and thus the result of the solution, are the incremental
 improvements 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p_{k}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta q_{m}$
\end_inset 

 of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}(t)$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{m}(\lambda,t)$
\end_inset 

 (An improvement of a parameter value means that it leads to smaller residuals
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{rs}$
\end_inset 

).
 Note that all parameters depend on time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset 

, but only the 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{m}$
\end_inset 

 depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

It is often possible to include 
\emph on 
other information
\emph default 
 in the form of extra equations, provided such constraints can be expressed
 in terms of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{m}$
\end_inset 

.
 This is important for bridging the gaps in the TEC sampling function.
 But since such constraints are usually based on specific assumptions about
 the ionosphere, their treatment has been resolutely relegated to the appendix
 (see section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec: Bridging-the-gaps}

\end_inset 

).
\layout Subsection

Inverting the solution matrix
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Inverting-the-solution}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Inversion of the resulting system of linear equations is equivalent to a
 Least Squares Fit (LSF).
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset 

 is non-linear, which will usually be the case, the solution is iterative.
 Each iteration uses parameter values

\end_inset 

 and

 that were estimated in the iteration before.
 Various non-linear solvers are available.
 This subject will not be discussed further here.
 
\layout Standard

The relative quality of the data (e.g.
 S/N) may be taken into account by assigning weights to their equations.
 It is also possible to constrain the rate-of-change of a specific parameter
 (see also 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Solving-for-time-dependence}

\end_inset 

), or to limit its range of possible values.
\layout Standard

NB: All the functionality discussed in this section is available in the
 MeqTree module.
 Its MeqCondeq nodes produce equations of the form of equ 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq: normal}

\end_inset 

, i.e.
 they make equations with derivatives for both sets  
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{k}$
\end_inset 

 of parameters.
 Its MeqSolver uses the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) approach for non-linear
 solvers.
 e quality of the fit is expressed by chi-squared, i.e.
 the sum of the squares of the residuals: 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}=\sum\Delta_{rs}^{2}$
\end_inset 

 .
 This should be smaller than a certain criterion, e.g.
 the expected rms measurement noise.
 It can be used to control the iterative process, but also to detect when
 the number of terms in the MIM function is no longer optimal, e.g.
 because the ionospheric conditions have changed.

Solving for time-dependence
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Solving-for-time-dependence}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Traditionally, in radio astronomy calibration, we deal in independent solutions
 for each time-slot (1-100s).
 This means that we do not make use of our 
\emph on 
a priori
\emph default 
 knowledge that the values of many parameters change only slowly in time.
 An example is the GPS bias, which unfortunately is different for each station-s
atellite pair, but which may be assumed to be constant during a satellite
 passage (see section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Measuring-TEC-GPS}

\end_inset 

).
 Using this information is vital, but before we can do this we have to solve
 some tricky implementation issues.
 Our MIM project is an excellent subject to adress this problem, the solution
 of which will have much more general applications for LOFAR.

Sampling the MIM function using GPS (and other) satellites
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Measuring-TEC-GPS}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

GPS satellites move in circular orbits around the Earth, with a radius of
 about 30.000 km (21000+6378), and with an inclination of 52 degrees w.r.t.
 the equator.
 At an arbitrary position on Earth, at least 6 of them are visible at any
 time.
 A passage from horizon to horizon takes a few hours, depending on its maximum
 elevation.
 Most satellites have low elevations, most of the time, and it is quite
 rare for one to be actually inside the LOFAR FOV (5-10 deg).
 In the future we also hope to use satellites of Galileo, Glonass etc.
 
\layout Standard

A sample 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 represents the integrated TEC along the line-of-sight between a station
 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 and satellite 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

.
 The station will have a fixed and accurately known Earth position 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{r},y_{r},z_{r})$
\end_inset 

, while the viewing direction 
\begin_inset Formula $(l_{rs},m_{rs})$
\end_inset 

 changes with time.
 Using a 2-frequency technique, a virtually instantaneous estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 of the integrated TEC may be made with a fundamental measurement 
\begin_inset Formula $noise$
\end_inset 

 of about 0.01 TECU (or 1 rad @ 74 MHz).
 Unfortunately, this is complicated by an unknown bias, which slowly drifts
 in time.
 Referring to equ 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq: Srs_generic}

\end_inset 

 above, the measurement function 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 for the GPS case can be expressed as: 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
Q_{rs}(t)=q_{rs}+q_{1r}t+q_{2r}t^{2}+\cdots+noise\quad TECU\label{eq: Srs_GPS}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Expressions for the derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial q}$
\end_inset 

 are readily determined from this.
 Of course, the slow bias drift may be expressed by other functions than
 these low-order polynomials.
 Note that the constant 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{rs}$
\end_inset 

 is associated with the station-satellite pair, while the drift parameters
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{ir}$
\end_inset 

 are associated with station 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

It would be nice if we could associate a bias value with each station, and
 each satellite.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 satellites and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset 

 stations we would then have only 
\begin_inset Formula $(n+m)$
\end_inset 

 independent bias parameters in 
\begin_inset Formula $(n\times m)$
\end_inset 

 samples.
 Unfortunately, this is not the case.
 But fortunately the bias drift is caused 
\emph on 
only
\emph default 
 by the station
\begin_inset Foot

\layout Standard

The bias drift are probably caused by relatively cheap electonics, operating
 in a relatively unstable environment.
 Both are better for the satellite.
 
\end_inset 

, so it is the same for all TEC measurements made between that station and
 different satellites
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

This has been established on real data.
 It is another indication that the drifts are caused by environmental variations
 (temperature, humidity) in the station electronics.
\end_inset 

.
 The problem is how to implement such long-term constraints.
 
\series bold 
(Brainwave: If we introduce deliberate station drifts, will that help to
 separate real TECs from biases....?)

Jim has verified that the bias problem will be much less (or even absent?),
 even if the 3rd frequency is relatively close to one of the others.
 Galileo will use 3 frequencies, and we should do tests with the WSRT station.
 GPS will probably have them earlier, so we should be ready to use them
 to maximum advantage at the earliest opportunity.
 This will not require any great changes in the scheme that is being discussed

 If anything, it will simplify it, and produce more accurate results.

 Using a model of the source, with the correct flux, polarization, position
 and shape (usually a point source), the phase error of each antenna may
 be determined with a

 of better than a degree, depending on the source brightness.
 This noise is much smaller than the GPS noise.
 Unfortunately, this is complicated by (at least one) unknown common phase

Just like the GPS case, we sample the MIM along a horizontal line in the

 The difference is that the horizontal constraint is much stronger than
 in the GPS case, mainly because all stations share the same offset.

Freq-dependence: To find the absolute TEC, and to use HBA values for LBA

\layout Standard

We now distinguish the following cases (..very incomplete...):
\layout Enumerate

One bright Cat I source, in the (main lobe of the) field-of-view (FOV).
 One offset.
 Sufficient for estimating a MIM function if the size of the array is larger
 than the 'footprint' of the FOV on the ionosphere.
 5 degrees = 0.1 rad -> 0.1x300km = 30 km.
 
\series bold 
So, for the full LOFAR, we get away with only ONE bright source, and a minimum
 of parameters....
\layout Enumerate

Multiple sources in the FOV: simultanous or peeling (contamination).
 Multiple independent offsets.
 Requires MIM to harmonize them.
 Works for arrays smaller than the fovprint if ...
 Simultaneous selfcal solution for multiple sources in the field will share
 the same phase offset, so that may be OK to estimate a 2nd-order ionosphere
 (MIM) over the entire field.

Multiple sources inside and outside the FOV: need rapid repointing for sensitivi

It should be noted that this is a relative improvement only.
 It harmonizes the unknown phase offset by making it consistent with the
 GPS MIM, but it does NOT increase the absolute accuracy, which remains
 at the level of 0.01 TECU, or 1 rad @ 75 MHz.
 However, the relative accuracy between LOFAR station phases will be 100
 better than a degree, i.e.
 100-1000 times better than the GPS accuracies.

Acquiring and maintaining phase-lock

It should be noted that a selfcal solution only works if there are no 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset 

 ambiguities, i.e.
 if the station phase errors are within about a radian to begin with.
 Since the ionospheric variations can be much larger than that, it must
 be tracked all the time.
 Also important for longer integrations on fainter sources, for LOFAR beamshape
 determination.
 The LOFAR phase-locking procedure (...legacy...).
 The latter is a continuous selfcal phase solution on one or more bright
 sources.
 It starts with 3 stations in the core.
 The other stations are included one by one, moving outwards from the centre.
 The phase of this new station is varied by steps of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$

, until the solution is consistent (phase-lock).
 Its phase will then be continuously tracked while the remaining stations
 are included, and during the subsequent observations.

Using a mix of GPS and astronomical TEC measurements, LOFAR may adopt a
 range of MIM-based procedures.
 In some ways, this is the central section of this document.
 
\layout Subsection

Default procedure
\layout Standard

Use an array of GPS stations around the LOFAR array to get a MIM to an accuracy
 of 0.01 TECU (equivalent to a phase of 1 rad @ 75 MHz).
 This is sufficient for acquiring phase-lock.
\layout Standard

Then use selfcal on the brightest Cat I source in the field to obtain phases
 for all telescopes (stations) in the array.
 Use these phases to constrain the MIM further, i.e.
 to obtain better values for the MIM parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset 

.
 This is a strong 'horizontal' constraint on the MIM.
 It must also be used to phase-track, i.e.
 to keep the ionospheric errors below one radian.
\layout Standard

The GPS samples provide a 'vertical' constraint on the MIM, because they
 have different directions.
 However ....
\layout Standard

The bright Cat I sources will be subtracted from the uv-data, using their
 'own' phases, for maximum accuracy.
\layout Standard

The fainter Cat II sources will be subtracted from the uv-data, using the
 phases calculated with the MIM function.
 
\layout Standard

The MIM function will also be used in imaging.
 Firsty to determine the optimum size of an imaging 'facet'.
 And secondly to correct the uv-residuals for the centre of each facet.

 Methods are needed to 'invert' the MIM into a 3D ionosphere.
 This is an interesting problem, but outside the scope of this document.
 In any case, looking at what is available at present, we may safely say
 that the use of any byproduct of LOFAR ionosphere calibration will vastly
 increase the resolution (in space and time) of ionospheric data.
 We may enter a symbiotic relationship, where they supply GPS data, and
 get LOFAR calibration data in return.

 Improve the 16 cm accuracy (1 TECU) that is available now.
 First by using the MIM to combine the measurements from an array of GPS

 The MIM principle endeavours to impose a 'harmonizing' constraint on a

 consistency with a minimum number of assumptions (or parameters).
 Such a principle may be useful in many areas, especially if we can offer
 a generic implementation (e.g.
 in MeqTrees).

\emph on 
the effects of

 the ionosphere above a radio synthesis array like LOFAR, has many advantages.
 Apart from providing an accurate value for the integrated TEC along an
 arbitrary line of sight, the MIM function may be used to 
\emph on 
harmonize
\emph default 
 the various TEC measurements from which the MIM is estimated.
 In practice this means that their various unknown offsets are made consistent
 with each other.

In radio astronomy calibration, the MIM is used for:

Combining astronomical and GPS measurements.

Faraday calibration (absolute TEC).

 The propagation velocity of radio waves is (slightly) reduced by the electric
 charge of its free electrons.
 Since the electron density, and thus the r

So an integrated TEC of 1 TECU causes the phase of a signal to change by
 -100 rad @ 75 MHz (

 It should be noted that the effect on the phase of a radio interferometer
 will be much smaller, because it measures phase

 So the

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

For the common case of large-scale ionospheric structure, i.e.
 travelling 'blobs' that are much larger than the array, there will be a
 (roughly) linear phase gradient over the array, which slowly changes in
 time: 
\begin_inset Formula $T\approx p_{0}(t)+p_{1}(t)\, x$
\end_inset 

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta T\approx p_{1}(x)\Delta x$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\phi\approx-25\lambda p_{1}(t)\Delta x$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, at any given time, the the interferometric phase error will increase
 roughly linearly with baseline length 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset 

 (and linearly with wavelength 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset 

), until 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset 

 becomes comparable to the scale size of the blobs.
 Often, this will be several 100 km.
 For a

Ionospheric delay
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Ionospheric-delay}

\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
L=\lambda\frac{\phi}{2\pi}\approx-4\lambda^{2}T\quad m\label{eq: TEC2meter}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

So, a TEC of one TECU corresponds to a delay of -64 m @ 75 MHz, or -16 cm
 @ 1400 MHz.
 Since the latter is roughly the frequency of the GPS carrier wave, we can
 also say that an error of one TECU in a TEC measurement would cause a position
 error of 16 cm.
\layout Standard

Like the differential phase in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Ionospheric-phase}

\end_inset 

, the error will be smaller for the determination of 
\emph on 
relative
\emph default 
 positions, i.e.
 the position w.r.t.
 another station with an accurately known position.
 Obviously, the magnitude of this error will increase with the distance
 to this reference station.
 For a large-scale ionosphere (see section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Ionospheric-phase}

\end_inset 

 again) the error will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta L=-0.16\: p_{1}(t)\:\Delta x$
\end_inset 

 m/km.
 With a maximum 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}=0.01$
\end_inset 

 TECU/km, this translates to a maximum 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta L=0.16$

 This becomes interesting for building contractors!

 But we assume (.?.) that this is corrected on-line in either the satellite

 Obviously, the accuracy of this correction will be limited by the ionosphere

Ionospheric Faraday rotation
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Faraday-rotation}

Just like the phase, the ionospheric Faraday rotation is related to the

 However, it also depends on the angle between the vecors of the line-of-sight

Compare this to expresssion

 Note that the actual Earth magnetic field deviates significantly from the

 The deviations in direction and strength vary as a position of Earth position

 Fortunately the vector-field 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{B}$
\end_inset 

 is still smooth on the scale of LOFAR.
 This means that, if the TEC is locally smooth (as we assume it to be most

All this is rather fortunate, because its makes it easy to distinguish troposfer

 The same goes for tropospheric extinction (e.g.

 The only amplitude effects of the ionosphere are focussing and decorrelation,
 which occur under conditions that are so bad that it is better to stop

Bridging the gaps in the MIM sampling function

The purpose of the MIM function is to provide reasonably accurate values

 This is equivalent with interpolation, where the accuracy is inversely
 proportional to the distance to the known sampling points.
 Therefore, we would like to minimize the gaps in the MIM sampling function
 (see the MIM diagram in fig 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:MIM diagram}

 If that is not possible, we shoud try to include other available information
 to constrain the MIM function in those gaps.
 As we will see, this usually involves some assumptions about the 3D structure
 of the ionosphere, thereby making our MIM less 'minimal' than we would
 like.
 That is why it is treated in this appendix.

 for 14 individual telescope phases when there is a 3C source (10-100 Jy)

 In general, the brightest source is only 5 Jy or less (give S/N calculations).
 In those cases, the data must be corrected with the help of calibrator
 observations before and after.
 At 115 MHz, this would have led to a rather poor dynamic range, because
 even the benign ionosphere of the fall of 2004 causes appreciable and time-vari

 Fortunately, there was usually enough flux in the available sources to
 solve for this phase-gradient (one parameter).

Relation to field-based calibration (Cotton, VLA)

Field-based calibration 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Cotton}

\end_inset 

 has been used succesfully by Cotton, Lazio and others to calibrate the
 ionosphere above the VLA.
 Especially @ 74 MHz (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=4$
\end_inset 

m, 
\begin_inset Formula $bw\approx1$
\end_inset 

MHz).
 The procedure is as follows:
\layout Enumerate

Every hour (or so), an instrumental calibration is done using the bright
 source Cas A.
 This removes the antenna-based phase errors, e
\emph on 
xcept for a linear phase-gradient over the array
\emph default 
, which is assumed to be caused by the ionosphere.
\layout Enumerate

Snapshot images are made every minute (or so), and the positions of the
 sources in the field that are bright enough to be detected are measured.
 These are compared to their catalog positions (NVSS, LVSS).
 
\layout Enumerate

The measured source position differences are converted into phase gradients.
 These are then used to fit an overall phase-function 
\emph on 
in the image-plane
\emph default 
 (e.g.
 a set of Zernike polynomials).
 Fitting entails finding values for the coefficients of the base-functions,
 so that the gradient is the same as the measured phase gradients.
\layout Enumerate

The end result is a group of time-series, each of which represents a time-depend
ent parameter of the ionospheric phase-function.
 
\layout Enumerate

The ionospheric phase function represents an image-plane effect.
 It is applied in the usual way, i.e.
 by facet imaging.
 The total FOV is divided up into a number of facets (in this case centered
 on the source used).
 The uv-data are corrected for the centre of a facet, and then transformed
 to a small facet image.
 These are then stitched together.
\layout Standard

The Zernicke polynomials are clearly a form of MIM.
 The difference is that they are derived from position measurements, which
 imply linear phase gradients.
 This assumption can only be valid for baselines smaller than about 5-10
 km.
 This is readily verified by looking at the consistency of the Zernicke
 solution per antenna.
 It deteriorates for the outlying VLA antennas, i.e.
 for the longer baselines.
 Nevertheless, field-based calibration has been quite succesful, but is
 limited by the VLA sensitivity @ 74 MHz.
 Recently, Cotton has been investigating alternative base-functions.
\layout Standard

Recently, Huib Intema 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Intema SPAM}

\end_inset 

 has shown that a MIM-based approach (SPAM) gives better results on the
 same data:
\layout Itemize

First, 27 antenna phases are obtained in the direction of each bright source.
 This is done by peeling 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{JEN peeling}

\end_inset 

, i.e.
 treating each source as though it is the only one in the field.
 This is done in order of decreasing brightness.
 Contamination from other sources is minimized by subtracting everything
 but the 'peeling' source.
 Depending on source brightness, the integration time of the solution is

He then uses the 27 VLA antenna phases (x,y,z,l,m) in the direction of each
 source (l,m) to solve for MIM parameters, i.e.
 the coefficients of a set of simple polynomials.

 Recently, Zernicke polynomials have been replaced with KL functions, giving
 a much better (smoother) behaviour far from the sampling points.
 Also, the noise in the final image was lower.

SPAM has all the ingredients that concern us for LOFAR: peeling, choice
 of MIM, solver integration times, visualization, etc.
 It is a prime candidate for implementation in MeqTrees.
 A possible improvement would be to express the antenna phases directly
 in terms of the (much smaller number of) MIM parameters, and solving directly
 for the latter.
 However, this approach may clash with peeling.....
